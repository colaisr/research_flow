# Research Flow - Value Proposition

## General Value of the Platform

**Research Flow transforms ad-hoc research and analysis into standardized, scalable, and transparent workflows.**

### Core Value Statement

Research Flow enables organizations to **automate complex research processes** that typically require:
- Multiple data sources (databases, APIs, documents, knowledge bases)
- Manual data gathering and synthesis
- Expert knowledge and time-consuming analysis
- Repetitive work that doesn't scale

**The platform solves the fundamental problem**: How to make expert-level research processes repeatable, scalable, and accessible to entire organizations—not just individual researchers.

### What Makes Research Flow Unique

1. **Universal Applicability**: Not limited to one domain—works for financial analysis, healthcare research, legal due diligence, supply chain optimization, and any other research-intensive process.

2. **Transparency & Control**: Every step is visible and verifiable. Users can see exactly what data was used, how it was processed, and why conclusions were reached.

3. **Tool Reusability**: Configure data sources once, use them across multiple research processes. A database connection becomes a reusable "tool" that any process can leverage.

4. **Knowledge Base Integration**: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) allows organizations to build internal knowledge bases (regulations, protocols, best practices) and use them in research processes.

5. **No-Code/Low-Code**: Business users can create research workflows without writing code, while technical users can extend with custom tools.
