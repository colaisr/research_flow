Title: Five Tips for Beginner Gardeners

1. Start with easy-to-grow plants such as basil, mint, lettuce, or cherry tomatoes.
2. Ensure your plants receive the right amount of sunlight—most vegetables need at least six hours per day.
3. Water deeply but not too frequently; roots need oxygen as much as moisture.
4. Use compost to improve soil structure and nutrient content.
5. Observe your garden daily to catch problems like pests or yellowing leaves early.
